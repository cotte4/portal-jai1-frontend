- Animated loading bar with brand colors

2. CONFETTI CELEBRATIONS
------------------------
Added canvas-confetti library with multiple celebration effects for key moments:

Triggers:
- Dashboard: When all 3 steps become complete (one-time only)
- Dashboard: When refund is deposited (one-time only)
- Tax Tracking: Federal refund deposited -> fireworks
- Tax Tracking: State refund deposited -> money rain
- Onboarding: Calculator shows estimated refund -> money rain
- Tax Calculator: Shows estimated refund -> money rain
- Referral Program: Copy code success -> quick burst
- Referral Program: Reach new tier -> stars + side cannons

Confetti is persisted in localStorage so it only shows once per milestone.
